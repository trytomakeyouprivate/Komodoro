# Komodoro
A "pomodoro timer" for making pauses at your PC. Locks the screen every half hour for 5 minutes, so that you make a break.

- After login your screen will be locked in 30min for 5min, like "pomodoro" but in KDE-wide
- If you want to pause the timer, execute the dedicated Appstarter named "Pause Komodoro" It will pause the timer and resume after a given amount of minutes
- If you enter `komodoro-remove` in the Terminal, it gets wiped from your system.
